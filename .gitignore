# Project specific
# analysis.ipynb
# We keep analysis.ipynb or generate_notebook.py? 
# Usually we keep the generating script, and maybe the output if user wants to see it on github.
# Let's keep analysis.ipynb in the repo so it renders on GitHub.
# But ignore the data if it was inside the notebook (it is embedded in outputs, which is fine)
